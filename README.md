# Machine_learning-Project1

üìù Project Documentation Overview
This machine learning project consists of the following main components:

Importing Required Libraries
----------------------------
Includes pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data processing and model building.

Data Loading and Inspection
The dataset is loaded using pandas, and initial exploration is done using functions like .head() and .info().

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder
Splitting data into features and target
Scaling features using StandardScaler

Model Building
A machine learning classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree) is trained using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation
Model performance is measured using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
